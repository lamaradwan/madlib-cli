**How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)**

- python ./series.py

**Tests**
- How do you run tests? 

Navigate to each test file then run it either from the UI of the code editor or the terminal
- Any tests of note? 

1. Before executing the tests, you should run the game with the testing inputs to make sure that external file is created or overwritten
2. Comment out the input collector before executing the tests since the test file will freeze wating for the collection while no collections in the test


- Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc

I had a good coverage I believe
